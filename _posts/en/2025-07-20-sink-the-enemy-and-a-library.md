### The Mystery of the Literary Refrigerator and the Pirate Adventure!

The last time I went to the "literary refrigerator," I didn't find many books there. To be honest, there was only one book that I don't think I would read if I had more options (but I'll talk about that in the next post!). Unfortunately, I believe the "refrigerator" will be removed, as on July 29th, it had very few books. Since it was truly abandoned in the park, perhaps its removal is for the best. But I found the book that's the subject of this post in a library I hadn't been to before, and best of all: it's right near where I used to get books from the "refrigerator"!

And today we're going to talk about the book "Sink the Enemy!" from the "Pirates Attack" series by Sebastiano Ruiz Mignone.

### Embarking with Captain Mongard

As you can see from the post title, the book is pirate-themed and takes us on a journey with Captain Mongard. He commands a fleet of two ships: the Coimbra and the Falc√£o. The story begins with Captain Mongard fleeing a battle against an English fleet much larger than his own.

With his fleet, Mongard decides to stop at an island to resupply the ships with water and food. But something unexpected happens: some of his men die of poisoning. Initially, they thought it might be snakes, but everything indicates that the island hid a volcano. Cracks opened in the earth and ended up swallowing more men.

### Meeting Timmy Kid and the 'Spitting Fire'

After that, the book introduces us to Timmy Kid, a boy who served as a general assistant on both ships. He did everything there, from carrying messages between ships to helping in the kitchen. It seems he had free access to any part of the ships. The book also tells that he was searching for his first sword and was still learning to fight.

On another of these stops, our pirate friends discover a Spanish ship to attack, called "Cospe Fuego" (named for its military power). The following pages are dedicated to the search and the strategy used against the powerful "Cospe Fuego."

### A Promising Ending and My Impression

At the end, the author seems to want to continue the story, as our friends, during the battle, find an unexplored map. On it, there appear to be solid gold statues! The book ends with them setting off in search of this location on the map.

So, what did I think of this book? Very good! It has a short section before we begin reading that describes our characters (their physical and even behavioral characteristics), which gives us a brief introduction to the story. Although the book seems more childish, it gives us a taste of what actually happened on these voyages at the time. For example, when they visited the island with a volcano, although I find it very unlikely that this actually happened.

What I mean is that there wasn't anything too fantastical about the book's story, like in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, for example. This gave me some credibility to the story (I think I'd read the series to see what happens from beginning to end and get a better understanding).
