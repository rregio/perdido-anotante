Have you ever wondered, "How can I be 1% better every day?" I recently saw a video where someone asked ChatGPT exactly that, and it got me thinking. I primarily use Gemini (Google's AI), and oddly, I had never thought to ask my AI this specific question myself. Lately, I've been using AI more than I'd ideally like, a habit I'm starting to recognize could easily become an addiction.

Perhaps I hadn't asked because, deep down, we all feel like we "already know" the answer. My initial thoughts immediately went to the usual suspects: drink more water, eat healthier (in moderation, of course), exercise more. And while Gemini did include these, it also went further, offering some surprisingly simple yet powerful insights.

These weren't just general tips. The AI suggested specific, small actions: read just one page of a book, do 5 squats, drink one extra glass of water than usual, organize a single drawer, meditate for two minutes, or send a kind message to someone. And crucially, it emphasized consistency – doing at least one of these things every single day.

Gemini offered other points too, but I decided to focus on these practical, everyday suggestions. I started detailing my current habits and goals to the AI, being completely honest. I confessed I was trying to read more, but wasn't exercising (and yes, I admitted I was overweight). I told it I didn't know how to meditate and wasn't good at organizing any space I occupy.

Unsurprisingly, Gemini suggested choosing one area to focus on first, particularly highlighting health given my confessions. It felt less like receiving expert consultation and more like being gently "guided" by a supportive friend. In that moment, talking to the AI, I clearly saw how lost I felt and how much work I need to do to improve. My biggest challenge, across everything in life, is consistency.

Talking to Gemini left me feeling genuinely motivated, especially as I jotted down these ideas in my notebook. But almost immediately, something else completely derailed me. You might be thinking, "Rodrigo, what could possibly stop you so quickly?" Well, yesterday I started researching how to get Google to better track and analyze this blog's pages. I got utterly absorbed in the technical side of things. Google's tools presented a series of analyses to run, and when I saw the blog's performance wasn't great, I became fixated on solving those technical problems instead.

Now, as I transcribe these notes for the blog post, I realize I've been so consumed by trying to fix the site's performance over the past couple of days that I've completely messed up my sleep schedule. It's currently past 11 PM on the 25th, and I haven't even begun to wind down for the night... It just goes to show, there's always something that pops up to distract me from the important personal changes I want to make, and I often end up sacrificing my well-being (like sleep) for whatever new fixation grabs my attention.

So, there it is. My attempt at the "1% better" journey hit an immediate, self-imposed detour. But maybe writing about it helps illuminate the pattern. Perhaps one day soon, I'll revisit this list (or a similar one) and actually start implementing Gemini's suggestions – or maybe another AI will give me the nudge I need!

Thanks for reading, everyone. Until next time.
