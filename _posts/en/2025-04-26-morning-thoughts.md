Good morning, and I sincerely believe that it will be a good day.

<img loading='lazy' alt="Morning thoughts a good day despite everything"  src="{{ '/assets/imagens/pensamentos-matinais-dia-bom.jpg' | relative_url }}" width="400" height="400">

Although yesterday (the 25th) I spent the whole day awake, yes, I stayed up all night. And from the 24th to the 25th (and even a little before) I spent some time trying to fix the blog's performance and performance issues for cell phones.

As for that, I couldn't fix much, and I even gave up, but I fixed other issues like accessibility and other things pointed out by LightHouse (an application within Google Chrome to solve these problems). Anyway, I believe that I worked well on this these days. But I hope to be able to fix this soon (I don't know when).

And yesterday (the 25th) I created the first video for the channel related to the blog, this didn't increase my confidence much, but as they say, you gain confidence with time, right?

I'm not sure yet, but my mother said that my niece would come spend the day with us. And that always cheers me up a lot, and she also said that we will have a meeting that evening about the products she sells, and I had said that I wanted to help her with this, and she wanted me to participate. I still don't know how, but I wanted to help her sell online, either here on this blog or maybe on another website. Speaking of which, she sells perfumes from Moments Paris, so if you want to help me or if you don't think much of me, help her (because she is the hardest-working person I know, there is no one here who is like her, I would like to help her more but my self-confidence doesn't allow it). Speaking of self-confidence, I hope that my shyness will allow me to talk about it with the company representative.

And that's basically it, I've already read and am reading the book “The Magic of Thinking Big” by David J. Schwartz. What might this have to do with this post? I could end this post here, but I'll give a brief summary of what I read today. And the book encourages exactly this, thinking positively in the morning trying to cheer yourself up, and that's exactly how I started the post.

But anyway, the book (in this section) talks about trust and that we should isolate fear and act constructively, in addition to keeping only good thoughts in our memory. And not allowing bad thoughts to return (this is something I still need to learn) because they become mental monsters. And by doing this we should also act in a way that our conscience does not punish us, and he gives tips on how to do this. And he says that when we go to a theater, or a meeting, we should sit right at the front (if possible in the first row), greet people by looking them in the eye (really staring, not in a negative way but in a friendly way), walk faster, talk more and smile.

Anyway, I think this meeting could be my opportunity to put this into practice, and if there is anything to comment on, I will comment... Today, at this moment, it is already the 27th and I have to say this meeting was not very productive for me, I still don't know how to help it. Anyway, I still feel lost and here I am walking, thanks...
