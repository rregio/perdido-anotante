As I mentioned in some of the previous posts, I think in [More about me]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/2025/04/04/More-about-me.html), I recently deleted a gaming channel that had a little over 1000 subscribers (around 1025). These notes below were from a very recent moment after I deleted it.

And then I started thinking about creating another one and below is a brief description of what it would be like. And I was thinking about segments or attractions, I don't know how to express this in English but in Portuguese they are called frames. And I was thinking about adjusting these frames in a week.

And here are some descriptions of what these frames would be like:

* Game in Game - in this frame I would play games that are inside other games. As many games are creating community game sections (as is done in Roblox and Fortnite already has) and I thought about making videos playing these games.
* Free Games On - Where I would play free games from various gaming platforms such as Xbox, PSN, Steam, among others.
* I Liked - Where I would play games that I like to play, such as Minecraft, Fortnite, Marvel Rivals, The Forest, among others.
* [Style] Day - Where I would play games of a certain style, such as horror, platform, FPS, among others.
* Special of the day - Where I would take the current date and search for the current day and search for any relation between a game and the day. For example, Wikipedia has a section where we search for events of the current date, so in it I would see events of today 04/07 (the moment I am writing this) and I saw that on 04/07/2001 the Mars Odyssey space probe was launched, and Odyssey reminds me of Mario Odyssey and if it were possible to play it, I would record myself playing it.
* Play this - Playing games requested by the community.

And in my notebook I wrote "Forget all this, please"... And that's why I don't want to make another gaming channel, at least for now...

This gaming community is strange, very addicted and competitive, and to have a fully active channel you need to have content every day, and that's really tiring... You always have to be excited, at least seeming to be, to talk and have something really interesting come out of it, and that's not my style.

And personally, I prefer to play more in my own corner, quietly, enjoying, testing, watching other games (while the community just waits for a game).

Anyway, these were the reasons I decided not to make a gaming channel... for now at least.
