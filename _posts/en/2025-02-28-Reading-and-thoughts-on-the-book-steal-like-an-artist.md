A while ago I read the book Steal Like an Artist and here are some points of what I thought of the book.

The book is good and encourages us to improve our skills and that we should imitate something in order to produce something... When we start programming, for example, we do and try to imitate the code of the best, always reading and updating ourselves. As they say, "Nothing is created, everything is copied" and that makes sense.

It also encourages us to do what we like so that the task we want to imitate doesn't become boring... Like fan fiction for writers. While I was reading it, it made me think that I don't have any particular tastes other than games and a few songs. In other words, there is little to inspire me.

At another point in the book, he encourages us to write things down more and the term he uses there is to use our fingerprints and not digital devices to do things. And in addition to this, he says that we often spend more time watching what others produce, and I'm like that too... I think I'm looking for inspiration, but I spend a lot of time watching.

At another point he talks about the great secret of life... Do good work and share it... I don't know if I'm doing it right, but I've always tried to share my stuff, but no one has been interested yet.

And it seems that from chapter 5 onwards the author moves away from encouraging the practice and starts talking about other things... obviously with some connection, but I didn't feel enthusiastic about continuing to read after this chapter... Despite everything, I read it in full and after chapter 5 he talks more about how to share your work... Living in the right place, having contacts, among other factors.

Anyway, it's a good book... I didn't find any answers... just more questions... And these are some of them:

How do I stay motivated to continue the practice??
Do I give up on things easily?? I don't think that's true, but could it be??
And what about the shyness to share these works (even if they're good)??

Anyway, I enjoyed the book and I'm currently looking to read and take notes...
