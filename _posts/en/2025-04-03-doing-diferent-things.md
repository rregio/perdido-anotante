And this note was a recommendation from the psychologist, where he asked me to do things that I don't normally do... Like cooking, and he gave me some recommendations.

And yesterday, April 2nd, I did some things that I had never done before... and they were in the kitchen... Very simple things, and it's amazing how simple things motivate us...

I couldn't do exactly as he suggested, he asked me to do things completely without outside help and if possible without anyone at home, which unfortunately I couldn't do because my mother refused to leave the house, so I just asked for advice on how to do it the way she normally does.

Of course, I had doubts about how to do things that I had never done before and I asked my mother. For those who want to know, what I made was a simple rice and beans (the beans were already half-cooked, all that was left was to defrost and season them).

I don't know if it was worth the experience due to these factors (not being able to get away from my mother and still having to ask her for recommendations). But anyway, it was done and it wasn't bad, practically the same as hers.

I still wanted to make other things, but the fact that she didn't make it makes it difficult for me to try again... But there are still things I want to make, like rice pudding.

If I make it, I'll post it here, but I don't know if I will. And so we end another note.
