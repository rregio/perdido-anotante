And this is a post talking about why I don't follow religion... Actually, this note was made after arguing with my mother about religion. And I said (and I think it really was) when my godmother said something like this "The kingdom of heaven does not accept shy people" and then I started to think this:

God decides to end the world now and I and everyone else will go to purgatory. When one of the angels at the gates of heaven asks some people close to me:

_What have you done in life?

_One day I killed my parents, but today I follow God's religion and I am completely sorry for what I did... (clear reference to the Richthofen case)

_What you did was wrong but you show remorse, welcome to heaven. NEXT...
_And what did you do?

_Nothing in particular, I was betrayed and that affected me a lot. (clear reference to one of the religious trend, if I can say so, that the church she attends made and even showed videos like this)

_You show resentment and resentment cannot enter heaven, NEXT...
_And what did you do?

_I'm Rodrigo and I haven't done anything special in my life, I've always been very shy and I think that got in my way a little.

_Hmm, shyness is it?? It's also not accepted in the kingdoms of heaven. NEXT...
_And what did you do?

_Me? I went to a school armed and killed 38 children but before I died I wrote a note showing repentance and killed myself because I thought I didn't deserve to live anymore.

_The most important thing is repentance, welcome to heaven!

And in my note I wrote a "IS THAT EXPLAINED?" very big... and I continue saying:
In short, whoever does something colossal wrong and shows remorse seems to have total support from society and whoever has a personal defect seems to have no support at all.

And so we end this note.
