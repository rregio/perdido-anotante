I recently saw an advertisement for the game Tibia and it got me thinking, which led to this note:

Ah, Tibia... it's so successful that I can't even imagine why... because the game doesn't seem that cool to me. I don't even know its history, so I don't understand its success.

I don't have much to say about it since I played it very little, but it made me think about the old games that are still active. And when I say old, I mean games that are about 20 years old or more.

* Priston Tale - This one was really cool, and back in the day, at the internet cafe I used to go to (actually, it was kind of my family's; we had a partner who brought the equipment, and we provided the location), it was a benchmark for knowing if computers were really good... A customer would come in and talk to my partner, and I would ask him (the customer or my partner): "And this PC, can it run Priston?" This game is really good, and I played it a lot, even though I couldn't progress much with my characters. I usually reached a level around 80 and couldn't advance any further... I think it was because I enjoyed staying at that stage.

* Mu Online - I think this was one of the first MMORPGs I encountered, and it has several private servers (they say you can still find them on social media) and also a Global server (I think it's the official one, but I'm not sure). It was cool, especially because of its really cool armor (the red set, whose name I don't remember, was awesome)...

* CS (Counter-Strike) - Oh, this is the game that helped create many internet cafes, late-night gaming sessions with friends, and the Rio de Janeiro map (I think it was version 1.6) with classic songs like "Meu vizinho jogou..." I don't even know if that was the real name of Bezerra da Silva's song... I liked playing with bots because I wasn't very good, lol.

* The Sims - And now, the game that I think is the most famous on this list (at least, the one I've definitely spent the most time playing), although I only played a little of its first version. But from the second version onwards, I've spent a lot of time playing... The second version is the best, and I also really liked the third one (the most up-to-date). And its most recent version (4) I like and play a lot when I do play it, but not as much as the second and third versions. Between versions 3 and 4, I definitely prefer 4 because we have more freedom to walk around the city, which versions 1, 2, and 3 don't allow as much. The third version doesn't seem to have been very popular with people, but it's the best version in my opinion.  

There are still games that were completely the opposite, but I still remember playing them a lot, like Gunz: The Duel. Note: this one had really great gameplay. Anyway, maybe Iâ€™ll talk about them later, but thanks everyone, and I'm out.
