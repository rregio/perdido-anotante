Recently, I came across a headline about the "longevity diet"—I don't remember where it was, but there's always something like that in the media—that promised to reveal the secret of living to over 100 years. As someone who hasn't lived half that long yet, the headline got me thinking, and I decided to jot down some thoughts. I'm no expert, but as an obese person halfway there, I have a unique perspective on the subject.

For me, longevity isn't about following rigid rules or secret formulas. The real secret, in my opinion, is finding balance. It's true that many experts recommend specific foods, and that's important. But the big takeaway is that we can eat anything, as long as it's in moderation. The biggest culprit isn't the food itself, but the excesses we create. We all struggle with this, and some excesses can become addictions. In my case, the challenge is sweets – I only stop eating when I'm finished. In fact, I have a few candies right now.

Another point that intrigues me is how we separate food from the rest of our lives. What's the point of having the perfect diet if we don't move? Walking and physical exercise, no matter how small, are essential for a healthy life. I confess that I struggle with this myself, encouraging myself to walk only occasionally. But I know that effort, no matter how small, makes a difference.

I also believe that stress levels are a crucial factor. Life is full of ups and downs, and overindulgence often becomes an outlet for stress. Fortunately, my family – especially my mother – helps me a lot in this regard. As they say, everything in life is a double-edged sword, with a positive and a negative side. Therefore, I don't believe there is a single recipe for happiness or longevity.

And speaking of happiness, another thing I believe greatly influences is frequent doctor visits (it may seem like it doesn't have much to do with it, but don't worry). This is a weakness of mine. I usually go to places I enjoy, and doctors, hospitals, health centers, and even pharmacies remind me of illness, which leads me to avoid them. The bureaucracy and delays in care only make the situation worse. For example, I feel like I should go to therapy, but the thought of constantly having to schedule appointments demotivates me. I think easy access to a psychologist should be a reality for everyone, but bureaucracy prevents me from going as often as I feel I need to.

Ultimately, my conclusion is simple: longevity is a journey of balance. Therefore, my "golden phrase" is: try to live without excesses!
