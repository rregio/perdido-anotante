Right after the previous notes (in the early hours of the morning) I decided to go for a walk, I just had my coffee and grabbed a few things (my notebook, a holder for my cell phone in case I had somewhere to film myself, some fruit and off I went). And this time I went the other way, towards the center of my city, where I don't have many memories but the path is more "deserted" (with lots of cars, but few people on foot so there were lots of people waiting for buses), if I can say that, along the road. And at this moment it's about 7:30, I left around 6:30, and so far I haven't seen anything very eccentric like the other way. I only saw a store that had the words "Q' bonita" on the door but the sign says "Ô linda" and it reminded me of the city of Olinda, I just don't know why.

Before I got to the park where I picked up some books, I remembered the rat from the movie "The Secret Life of the Animals" and I started humming the chorus of the song "It's bombastic, and fantastic blah blah blah and a mister blow ow ow ..." lol I don't know why either (I think it was the way, there was a dirty stream next to it)...

I was going to pass by the park (where I picked up some books) but it was closed, because it was a Monday, and I couldn't even drink water there (but no problem, I had my bottle full of water). Between the two gates of the park I saw a place with a sign that said "EcoPoint" I think because it was a place where there were some dumpsters, probably provided by the city, but it was also kind of full and dirty. It didn't remind me of anything ecological, but anyway, I can't complain. And once again I remember the rat from the movie and I hum along the way...

It's now 8:02 and I'm at the bus stop where I used to catch the bus to go home from my last professional experience, which was a company related to transportation, speed cameras and traffic lights. And I only stopped because I spent a lot of time anxious to get home...

I got to the city center and I can't say much about the park until here where I am because the path is along the road and full of weeds on all sides, so I don't remember much about this area. And now it's 8:27 and apart from what I've already said here, I only passed by a sundial, without the rod standing vertically because it was broken... and I think it's just a clock now (or not lol). And then I sat on a bench in Praça do Coreto (I even took a picture of the bandstand there, if I can, I'll see it below).

This is a historic city and there is a church and a museum nearby, but it is now completely closed, although since it is a Monday I think the windows should at least be open. A while ago I visited this museum, and if I am not mistaken it even had his bed (I just don't know if it was really his lol).

After all this I went to look for an ATM to withdraw twenty reais because when I walk like this I usually don't walk back. I went to a market, but the ATM didn't have any notes in the amount of 20 reais (only 50 and up), so I had to take a little time downtown and left downtown towards Alphaville (the richest neighborhood in the region).

It is now 9:48 am and the sun is already strong and I don't know how much I will walk. I should have filled my water bottle at the municipal terminal, but I decided not to (who knows when the last maintenance was), I will save my water. Now I am close to the bridge that crosses the Tietê River and by some miracle it doesn't stink today. And from here I don't know much about it and I've only ever taken the bus around here, so I'm going to try to follow the route as best I can remember. I hope to be back by noon, and my feet are already hurting.

I got somewhere in this area, it's 11:10 and I still haven't reached any of the residential areas (I wanted to get to at least 12, but I don't know which one is closest to the center, but I wanted to). I took a few entrances around here and I can't see the buses that take me close to home. I mentally wonder if I'm lost, but I hope not. I passed by a terminal that gave me a view of the quarry that's near my house (about one to two km away) and I also took some photos and a video of it. And now I'm sitting at a stop and writing while I rest. I saw a sign for a UBS and thought I could get water there, let's see if I can find it.

Well, I've already gone back home (at 12:00 and now it's after 13:00) and on this way I also found a park called "Tierra del Fuego". Initially I see something that looks like a grandstand and a lake with some ramps, I imagine there must be some kind of show going on there. I saw the sign and there is also a zip line, and one of those climbing walls. It seems really cool, but it is closed today, maybe I will go back there to see it better... In fact, maybe I will do this route again, because there are some things I would have liked to have seen, like the park (to drink some cold water), the Anhanguera museum (see if that bed is still there) and this park that I had never seen before.

It's interesting how a walk in places we've never been can make us discover new places. For example, I had no idea that there was something like this park in my area.

So if you are interested in any of these points, I can redo the route on a Friday or Saturday (busier days) in these places. Oh, I'll see if I can make a video with the photos and videos I took on this route, if I do I'll post it here too for you to see... Thanks everyone and I'll go.
