Yesterday I found myself thinking about what I could do to write more (if possible) and with the book I read (in fact, I'm still reading it) I had an idea and the author said that when he was a child his mother would take him to the mall and there he would do the exercise of sitting and observing (or should I say judging, lol) the people he saw there, and trying to imagine what these people do. And that gave me a little idea...

I live in a two-story house, and right below my balcony there is a bus stop and I thought about always doing this, so that I would always have content to write (both on the channel, by the way I owe more videos there, and here on the blog). I checked with my favorite AI ways to do this, and it always has an answer for everything.

But now when I woke up I found myself thinking and remembering this, I kept thinking about this... All ideas are good and success depends exclusively on the execution of the plan, and I noticed that I never have a plan for anything and everything seems so doomed to failure. And then I continued... Calm down Rodrigo, don't think like that, let's look at the positive side.

I did a quick search about this and didn't find anything similar, so I thought this could be a positive point... Let's try it for a few days and turn this into content and who knows, maybe it will yield some good results, and I even added: Go out there and do a test, write down some people now, let's go! Get excited!

#### Putting it into practice!

And so I did, here's a short text of what would be the "Annotated Daily Life" (I even created the name, but I still don't know if I'll do it) and here's what I saw there:

I only see a couple, the skinny, brunette girl, with straight hair, tight pants on her legs. And the guy with baggy clothes and curly hair, both wearing dark clothes. At first I imagined they were going to work, and then I imagined if they were going to a park, to meet their friends, because their clothes were ordinary and they didn't look like they were going to work and they were young. And I also didn't imagine it would be a date, they seemed a little distant and not like they were dating. And I only had time to imagine this because they quickly got on the bus.

And that's it, this was my initial note and I feel like I'm trying to find myself as I read, the ideas aren't good but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading.
