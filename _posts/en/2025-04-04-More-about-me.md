Hey guys! To start off, this is my first post here at "Perdido Anotante".

<img loading='lazy' alt="More about me" src="/assets/imagens/mais-sobre-mim.png" width="400" height="400">

First of all, I wanted to explain that this blog will be like my notebook, you know? I got a little notebook to write down everything, and here I'm going to write down those notes.

But before I start writing anything down, I wanted to share a little bit more about myself... So you can understand the whole thing:

As a teenager, I wanted to be a designer, somehow. It didn't work out. I ended up taking a building course to see if I could draw some better houses, at least. Then, the idea was to go into architecture, but that didn't work out either. I ended up getting a job as a designer's assistant... It was a start, but it was in the industrial area and I only drew drill bits for implant dentistry. You know those little drill bits that doctors use to drill bones, both in teeth and for other things? So, it was one of those...

Things kind of didn't go well and I started wanting to go into the IT area. I dreamed of being a programmer when I was 25. I went to college to study Data Processing Technology, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find an internship. So I went looking for a job as a Help Desk analyst, the famous N1 (which, if I'm not mistaken, was the lowest level, I just answered the phone and said a technician would get in touch). I got a few short-term jobs like that, the longest was about 3 years. I went to college again and finished in 2019, Computer Network Technology, but I always had my eye on programming... I was still determined to achieve this, even though I was a little discouraged.

Then, my professor decided to give me a boost and hired me as a Junior programmer. The first time, I was really happy! But it didn't last long, about 6 months, I think. I didn't adapt very well, I think because it was so far from home... It took me more than an hour and a half to get there, and on the way back I went to college (which was on the way), but I would get home around midnight. As a result: I would arrive at work exhausted and unable to perform, I would end up collapsing while sitting down.

I finished college and went to another one, this time in Computer Engineering, in 2020. I passed the entrance exam and shortly after I got another job, closer to home... It took me less than an hour to get there, but, to my dismay, I still had trouble sleeping, I didn't fit in at work and I was fired (I was already kind of crazy because I couldn't get it right, I felt useless).

After that, a short time later, I dropped out of college to study Engineering... Recently, a while ago (on 12/25/2023), I created a YouTube channel for gameplays. It was focused on Fortnite (by choice of the guys). I tried to bring some different games, but I only got criticism. Result: I deleted the channel. I already had over 1000 subscribers, almost monetizing... But, damn, mentally I was in a hole and gave up on everything. Now I'm here, a little lost, wanting to find myself again... So, do you guys want to follow me on this?
