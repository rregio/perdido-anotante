As I said, I'll post everything here... and this was one of my first notes since I decided to write everything down.

And on that specific day, we were talking about difficulties and I wondered if I could have some psychological problem like autism, and he asked me to write down things that I remembered that I had difficulties with as a child... I didn't remember many, but here's what I wrote down:

* riding a bike (I was able to ride when I was over 15)
* tying shoelaces (I don't remember exactly how old I was, but it togit addok me a while)
* I still haven't given up some habits (childhood habits, I shouldn't mention them here, but here goes), like eating my own boogers (I still do today), scratching wounds to get rid of the scab... These were the ones I remembered and still do today.
* It took me a while to stop wetting the bed (I stopped when I was over 20)

Anyway, these are all the things I remembered and told him... He said it could be feelings to get attention... Really??
