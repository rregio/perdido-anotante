So, how are you? I hope you're doing well, I can't say the same about myself... I don't know how much I'll write here (since this isn't a notebook entry) the fact is that I haven't been able to read anything for a while now... and even less to write... I'll be back soon (I hope). What happened?? Nothing too extraordinary, just that lately I've been feeling some discomfort.

I won't give details because I don't even know what I have, all I know is that I was recently diagnosed with gallstones (I know it's not serious) but according to Google it somewhat matches the symptoms (discomfort in the right side of my belly, no pain yet), and don't worry, I didn't look up the symptoms right away, first I looked up the gallbladder and according to Google it's also on the right side. And then I looked up some symptoms.

And these days the discomfort seems to be getting worse. I'm going to the hospital nearby tomorrow and I don't want to give my family (my mother) any more trouble. Speaking of her, she gave me a new cell phone because mine was already falling apart (the screen was peeling off, but it was working). I wish I had bought it myself, somehow, since I'm currently unemployed and without a single cent in my accounts, it's impossible.

I even have some money saved, but it's invested and I'll probably only be able to take it out in September. I talked about getting back to her, but she didn't want to and preferred that I reinvest it, which is what I'm going to do (with a heavy heart). And I'm going to try to make the channel again (which I actually already have) even if I have to say nothing with a horrible gameplay like Goulart. I just don't want to make the video with the c# face I've been having recently (due to this inconvenience).

I also recently created another blog, which I'm still going to try to do, it's already online, it's [deviagames](https://deviagames.netlify.app/) where I intend to talk about these 3 words (dev - development, ia - intelligence and games - I don't even need to say it, right?) I was thinking about creating this blog as a job (researching a subject somewhere, commenting giving my opinion and publishing). Maybe I'll come back, especially since the blog is already online...

And I even tried to make it with the cursor IDE, the one from the guy who developed a game from scratch with just AI and monetized the entire game by placing ads, but I haven't been able to continue yet. But it's on my to-do list... Also on my to-do list is trying to do more exercise (even if it's just a walk) who knows, maybe I can combine all of this into one thing. I'll try to make a list of what I want to do every day:

* Wake up
* Initial care (wash my face, brush my teeth, etc.)
* Read something...
* Exercise (walk initially)
* Tasks for the deviagames blog (research, write an opinion, publish) and have lunch in the meantime.
* End-of-day tasks (play, read or write for this blog)
* Final care
* Sleep

And that's it, if everything goes well I'll follow this plan every day... if I give up on something (as I always do) I'll let you know here (or try to let you know)... And now I'll go to sleep smelling of the pizza that my people here at home are eating...
