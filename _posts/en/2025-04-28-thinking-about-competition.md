I'm thinking about the book I'm reading, The Magic of Thinking Big, and I just finished chapter 4 and at the end it gives a list of situations, petty thoughts (the author's words) and big thoughts. And below is an "example" of what it's like and the part that made me wonder more about it.

<img loading='lazy' alt="Pensando sobre concorrÃªncia" src="{{ '/assets/imagens/pensando-sobre-concorrencia.jpeg' | relative_url }}" width="400" height="400">

| Situation | Petty thought | Big thoughts |
|---|---|---|
| competition | competing with the average | competing with the big ones |

And here's what I thought: Would it really be better to compete with the big guys? Like in my case where I feel totally lost and defeated, I don't think it would be better to compete with the big guys (the best at something).

I feel that if we want to face the big guys we should prepare ourselves first, if I were to try to return to the IT area today I feel that I would try to develop a personal project in order to try to prepare myself beforehand. And if I'm satisfied with the projects I would look for selection processes, but I don't think I would venture into a company like IBM, or any other big company. I honestly feel that this would be stupid, considering my case, but thinking about it on the one hand I believe that this would make me feel complacent.

Just like I've felt before, but fighting against the big guys would only make me feel worse than I already do.

#### And now a little bit of what I imagine won't go very far... the Annotated and Invented Everyday Life.

Well, let's go back to everyday life, where from my balcony I see people waiting for the bus and I try to describe them and maybe make up stories about them... and now I see 3 women, two of whom are talking, and the other one is a little far away. The darker one alone seems to be over 30 (maybe even older). I can't describe her very well because I can barely see her clothes, she's behind a parked car and I only see her face. And she seems to be going to work, and she spends most of her time looking at her cell phone.

And about the ones talking, there's a blonde with wavy hair, lighter jeans and she seemed to be going to the bank or to some daily commitment like going to work. She was taking a minibus, which makes me think she was going to the city center or catching the train, and I imagine she had some job like working as a banker. And the other one arrived a little later, and is still here (some things happened while I was writing them down, it must have taken me about 10 minutes) and the brown (light brown) woman with black hair and a floral outfit (monochromatic but floral) who was initially talking to someone on her cell phone. She seemed to be "threatening" (trying to force someone to do something she wanted) someone like her son or her husband.

About the things that happened that I mentioned earlier, they were, first a pigeon that got stuck in the glass (which protects my house from the rain, otherwise it would flood every heavy rain), a loose animal I wrote again, and another was my mother arriving. And a little later I went back to watch and the two of them caught the same bus.
