I was thinking about whether to post about this consultation and the note because it is something very personal... But here goes...

![Another consultation, other notes](/assets/imagens/outra-consulta-outras-anotacoes.jpeg)

About this consultation, the doctor mentioned my relationship with my brother and he said something about jealousy or envy of him.

In the consultation, he had said that my brother is more "free"... I don't know if I'll be able to explain it here... And there I said that I don't remember having been jealous or envy of him...

And there I said that he was always treated differently, and even my father confirmed this before he left us, not that he wasn't nice to me, but he always did different and cool things like swimming, playing sports (not that I didn't play, I played basketball before and he played soccer), he always had friends while I didn't have many, but he had about 4 whenever he came over...

And in my notebook after writing this, I had a crying fit and what I wanted to say here is that there may be something related to this, but if there is, it could be from something very old.

And that's today's note, thanks and I'm off.
