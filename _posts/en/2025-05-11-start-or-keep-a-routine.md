Starting something new is always full of energy and anticipation. Whether it’s a diet, an exercise routine, learning a new language, or any other **new habit**, the kick-off usually comes with excitement and planning. But the big question that haunts me (and maybe haunts you too!) is: **what’s harder – starting a new routine or actually maintaining it in the long term?**



Recently, I’ve seen some content arguing that **starting** is the hardest part. I confess that my experience points to the opposite, and I want to explore why this is the case, by sharing my own journey with **habit maintenance**.

#### Why does starting a routine seem easier?

Let’s think about my morning walk, how I would do my routine. To start tomorrow, you would plan: set a bedtime, set the alarm, maybe sort the laundry. It’s a **new task** to be done, and the novelty itself brings a certain excitement. This is the idealization moment, when everything seems possible and the future benefits are already shining in my eyes.

For example, if I were to start a walk at 6 am, I would organize myself the night before, envisioning the satisfaction of achieving the goal the next day. It is a focused effort on the "now" and the "next step". And it is relatively easy to do this for a day or two, driven by this **initial motivation**.

## The Real Challenge: Maintaining the Routine Beyond the Excitement

This is where things get tough. The **initial excitement** inevitably diminishes. The **routine** ceases to be new and becomes, well... routine. And it is at this point that **discipline** and **motivation** are put to the test.

A warm bed on a cold morning becomes a powerful argument. The "just a little bit more" becomes a constant temptation. There are days when you simply don't feel well enough, physically or mentally, to carry out the plan. And, little by little, the lack of immediate visible results (or the difficulty in noticing them) can undermine your willpower.

Another thing that really bothers me is the **lack of company**. Starting and **maintaining a routine** alone is, for me, much more difficult. Although the responsibility is ours, sharing the journey with someone – even if it’s just to talk about the challenges and small victories – brings extra motivation. You encourage the other person, the other person encourages you, and a positive cycle of support and **continuous motivation** is created.

## My Practical Experience: The Journey (and Stop) of Walking and Dieting

Yes, I’ve been in exactly that situation. I planned and started an **routine** of exercise and healthy eating at the end of 2019. It included walking, jumping rope and a diet focused on vegetables and proteins, replacing the traditional rice and beans (yes, it was a big change!).

I started out super excited, doing it every day. At first, I would go to squares and parks. Over time, and crucially, as the pandemic progressed, these places began to close, and I had to adapt, walking the streets.

My **motivation** was waning. I tried other things to keep going, like a type of crossfit and even going to the gym – something I never liked. Looking back, this attempt to force something that I didn't enjoy may have contributed to **giving up**.

The benefits, however, were huge and visible! In just over 6 months, I went from 120kg to 98kg. I felt great, with more energy and disposition. Healthy eating and **physical activity** combined really worked for me.

However, with the pandemic intensifying and the changes I needed to make to my exercise routine, I ended up stopping everything. Trying to maintain something that had become boring and the lack of structure (with the places closed) were significant barriers.

## Lessons Learned and the Future (With Reservations)

Despite having stopped, I can clearly see the benefits I have obtained. And yes, I believe I would do it all over again, but with important lessons:

1. **Focus on what works and gives me pleasure:** Walking and jumping rope worked for me. The gym, no. It is important to find **physical activities** that you enjoy.
2. **Flexibility in your diet:** Completely replacing rice and beans can be very restrictive in the long term. Finding healthy recipes and sugar-free sweets is a good alternative, but with more flexibility.
3. **Seek support:** The **lack of company** weighed on me. Finding a friend, an online group, or even sharing on the blog (check it out!) can help maintain **motivation**.
4. **Taking care of your mental health:** I mentioned that today I don't feel well psychologically to start over. Recognizing this is crucial. **Mental health** is the foundation for **physical health** and **habit maintenance**.

## And for you: What is the biggest challenge?

This is my story and my thoughts on **starting and maintaining a routine**. And you, what do you find more difficult? The initial excitement or the **discipline** to continue day after day?

How do you deal with **loss of motivation**? Do you have any strategies to stay on track?
